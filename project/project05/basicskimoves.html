        For your first couple runs down the groomers it is in your best interest to make sure you execute either pizza and French fries as you create large “S” shapes all the way down. To maintain control over your run you need to make sure that your turns are not short and that you are traveling from one side of the mountain to the other slowly. Remember, your first season should be a time to focus on you technique and getting comfortable with managing to get all the way down the mountain during your runs without falling over.
